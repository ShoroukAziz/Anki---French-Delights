# Anki-French-Delights
a template and plugin for Anki

this is a set of models (Templates) for Anki (For learning the French language) with extra features and an intersisting design
I've created a light version that only have the basic design elemnts to be reused with any other language too.

## The main features :
### The Plugin :
  * searches for examples (that already exisits in your collection ) that fits your card and assign those examples to your card
  * randomly assigns an example to be displayed on each card (so you don't get used to a word in only one contex)

### The Template :
  * a different background color for each part of speech
  * contains a set of side menus that can show or hide the following fields :
    * menu 1 : IPA - Part of Speech - extra examples
    * menu 2 : etymology - mnemonic - tags
    * menu 3 :
      * highlight the differences between the french and english words
      * show your own higlighting
      * higlight the differences between the feminin and masculin versions of a word
      * shows the plural form of the noun and highlits the difference between it and the singular form
  * displays wether the card is new , young or mature
  * a set of buttons to search for the word in ( collins , google , wikishinari and linguee )
  * BETA : displays the conjugations of each verb with examples
