this is a set of models (Templates) for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (For learning the French language) with extra features and an interesting design
I've created a light version that only have the basic design elements to be reused with any other language too.

## The main features :
### The Plugin :
  * searches for examples (that already exists in your collection ) that fits your card and assign those examples to your card
  * randomly assigns an example to be displayed on each card (so you don't get used to a word in only one context)

### The Template :
